# Layout:
# Extract fastas from ncbi database for gene/mrna sequence (input by user). 
# Edit Fasta sequence so it can be compaired to primer sequence.
    # Remove all parts of fasta file except for the sequence or multiple sequences themselves.
# Compare the primer sequence with database sequence.
# Return values of score lengths, location of primers, and length between primers (cDNA length).
# If sequence is not 100% match for gene, search ncbi database for best predicted match (by e-value).
    # Return this to user.
