# Python-Work
## Hello!  You've come to the right place!
Well, if you were looking for a novice's Python work.

Something cool *might* be here, *sometime*. Say, ten years?

I am a graduate student in the Genetics training program at UW-Madison.
So far, I've needed to create some scripts to sort and combine various 
datasets from multiple csv files, and have a few on this repository that
could potentially be used in other settings.  As of now they are specific
to my files, but the logic might be similar to that needed for your scripts.
Still a novice, but if anything looks like something you could use feel free
to email me!
