# Python-Work
## Hello!  You've come to the right place!
Well, if you were looking for a novice's Python work.

Something *might* be useful to you here *sometime*.

Probably not for a while.  Come back in a few years if not impressed.

I do have a pretty entertaining Rock, Paper, Scissors game as of this writing.
